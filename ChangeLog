 9. Use list style pop-up for non-editable combos when not using Gtk-style
    combos - matches KDE behaviour.
10. Fix buttons in chromium's menu - mouse over colour, and text colour when using

18. For configs older than 1.7.2, disable usage of alpha channel to draw rounded
    tooltips and popup menus. Too many issues with apps to enable this by default.

1.7.1
-----
1. Use rgba colormap to draw rounded tooltips and popup menus - gives nicer border.
   This may be disabled via KDE4 config dialog.
2. Allow 'menus' of non-editable combos to be rounded. (But *only* if the app can
   be set to use an rgba colormap)
3. Remove resize grips - kwin handles this.
4. Add mouse tracking to treeview lists.
5. Indent treeview selection as per KDE.
6. Dont use GtkStyle to draw treeview lines. Use custom code which matches previous

 5. Add option to use thinner frames, focus, etc.
 6. If not rounding, enable all 'square' options.
 7. Store background colour setting in XProperty - so that this can be used by
    QtCurve kwin decoration. (At the moment, this is just the palette background)
 8. Add position setting for background image; top left, top middle, top right,
    bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right, left middle, right middle, and centred.
 9. Use square tooltips by default. (Problems have been reported with Pidgin and
    rounded tooltip - but I cannot reproduce these!)

11. Fix reading of QtCurve supplied default kdeglobals file.
12. Fix rounding of troughs of progressbars within treeview.
13. When using glow focus, dont draw glow focus and line focus on button of editable
    combo - jsut draw line.
14. Improve background gradient performance - only re-draw on size-request if size
    is different from last time.
15. Dont overwrite user supplied CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
16. OpenOffice.org fixes:
        - toolbar buttons when using max rounded buttons.

-----
1. Apply background opacity to menubars and toolbars.
2. Always use text colours when drawing labels on a GtkOptionMenu.
3. If using background opacity, draw rings and background gradient under
   menubars and toolbars - this matches the KDE4 behaviour.
4. Disable the support for 'fix parent-less dialog' option - this causes too many
   issues with applications to be worth the fuss. If you really want this enabled,
   use the -DQTC_ENABLE_PARENTLESS_DIALOG_FIX_SUPPORT=true cmake option.

1.6.2
-----
1. Theme evolution's headers as headers, and not buttons.
2. Set fallback icon theme to gnome instead of hicolor. This helps with some
   missing icons in evolution.
3. If drawing a background image, ensure that this can also be drawn onto kwin
   border - if it has a bottom edge.
4. Attempt to fix light text on dark background for OpenOffice.org
5. Use same radius for all corners of progressbar.
6. Apply menu background settings to menus of non-editable combos. (Rounding is
   not applied due to clipping/shadow issues with Gtk2)

9. Allow rounded menus when rounding is set to slight.

1.6.1
-----

5. Fix kwin titlebar blending for striped backgrounds.
6. Use flat selection for items of editable combo - matches KDE4 better.
7. Simplify faded menu item code.
8. Dont use gtk_style_apply_default_background for resize widgets - messes up
   translucency!

1.6.0
-----
 1. Add 'glow' focus option - this is now the default. (Note, for firefox
    the label of checkboxes and radiobuttons will have a rounded focus rect
    drawn - this is because the 'glow' does not seem to work for firefox's
    usage of checks and radios).
 2. Fix potential crash in rgbToHsv
 3. Use square-ish focus for view items if using squared selection.
 4. Store dialog/window opacity in an XProperty - so that kwin theme can use
    this as the titlebar opacity.
 5. Don't hide focus rect on listview headers when mouse-overed.
 6. Fix crash due to missing gtk_widget_get_allocation - this was only
    introduced in Gtk 2.18.0
 7. Group boxes need to respect 'square frames' setting.
 8. Some Java Swing fixes/workarounds:
     - always use plain slider style
     - dont depress sliders

10. Added options to draw shaded, or faded, group boxes.
11. Added options to specify location of group box label; inside, outside.
12. Dont use the 'no buttons' scrollbar setting for mozilla apps. This setting
    seems to cause odd behaviour with the horizontal scrollbar (sometimes it is
    not displayed). Use signle top/bottom left/right buttons instead.
13. Draw coloured mouse over for 'checked' toggle buttons.
14. Fix look of some sunken toolbar button in firefox.
15. Use Highlight colour for default button glow.
16. When KDE4's 'Inactive selection changes colour' setting is enabled, dont change
    the selection colour - use same colour, but set 50% transparent.
17. Add "npviewer.bin" to list of apps that are brower plugin viewers - opacity
    settings are excluded from these.
18. Exclude opacity settings from SWT apps (e.g. eclipse), totem, and sonata.
19. Default sub-menu popup delay to 225 - matches Gtk2 standard default. The previous
    default of 100 seems to cause issues with Thunar.
20. Extend background gradients into window decoration.
21. Fix faded menuitems when using menu background gradients.
22. If background gradient has a 'shine', then when used for backgrounds draw a
    radial gradient top centered.
23. Use arrows on pathbar buttons.
24. If using compositing then use rounded and semi-transparent tooltips. (Note:
    when using rounded tooltips, the kwin shadow dissapears.)
25. Add option to force square tooltips.
26. Reduce GdkGC usage - use cairo for text layout.
27. Add a hack to work-around issues with NVIDIA and cairo 1.10. This 'fix' invloves
    duplicating the 1st and last stop in a gradient - and may have an impact on
    performance. To enable this, pass -DQTC_CAIRO_1_10_HACK=true to cmake.
28. Improve tab mouse-over code.

1.5.2
-----
1. Apply opacity settings to inactive tabs.
2. Add config option of apps that should not use menu opacity.
3. Add inkscape to list of apps to exclude opacity settings from.
4. Exclude opacity settings from browser plugins - nspluginviewer,
   plugin-container, and chrome (instance used to load plugins).
5. Exclude opacity settings for openoffice.org - crashes otherwise!
6. Check widget's colormap before drawing transparent.
7. Support non-integer font sizes - patch from Alyssa Hung

1.5.1
-----
1. Fix drawing of square frames, when general setting set to round.
2. Dont draw thumbs on circular sliders - they dont look good!

-----
 1. Add striped window and menu background options.
 2. Added options to not square frames and tab frames.
 3. Animate faded progressbars when animation enabled.
 4. Blend menubar and window titlebar gradients if:
         menubar, titlebar, and inactive titlebar gradients match AND
         not blending titlebar gradient AND
         using window titlebar colour for menubar AND
         extending window drag into menubar
 5. Default titlebar colours to window colours - matches KDE4 default.
 6. If using window border colours as menubar colours, and the active and inactive
    titlebar colours are the same, then always use the active titlebar text colour
    for the menubar.
 7. When shading menubars only when active, or using window border colours as menubar
    colours, track the active window using a X11 event sent from the QtCurve kwin
    decoration.
 8. Fix border of radio buttons when general round setting is set to square.
 9. Always use a 1 pixel border for toolbars - as using a border of 0 can cause
    items of adjoining locked toolbars to be too close.
10. Add separator to messafge dialog boxes - matches KDE.
11. Add option to act upon titlebar buttons to hide menubar and statusbars.
12. Fix plain/round sliders being rotated when using a custom slider width.

10. Decrease size of SWT toolbars.
11. Disable background image and gradient for SWT apps.
12. Only allow QtCurve's colours to be overridden if they come from QtCurveRcStyle
    or GtkRcStyle. Also, in the case of root, disallow 'ToolTip' and 'default'
    styles - as if app is run via kdesu/kdesudo, these could potentially be the
    user's colours. This should stop other theme's / user's colours from interfering.
13. If using KDE4/Qt4 colour settings, only force the colours for buttons that are
    disabled. This fixes the coloured text on GWave's buttons.
14. Fix shading of menubars and when using flat menubar appearance and background
    image/gradient.

17. Fix calculation of alpha values for square rings.
18. Fix progressbar glow central position.
19. Draw more frames.
20. Fix image/gradient background issues with wxWidgets applications.

   non coloured default buttons.

1.0.0
-----
 1. Added option to colour selected check/radios.

21. Better match of line-edit and spinbutton heights to KDE4.
22. If user is using menubar colouring, and this would require changing the text
    colour, then need to modify the user's userChrome.css for this - regardless

23. If editing/creating userChrome.css and chrome folder does not exist, then
    create it.
24. Theme icon view selections.
25. Theme entry progress.
26. Supply a default kdeglobs file (installed into QtCurve's gtk-2.0 folder) so
    as to allow easy modifications of default settings.
27. Added option to draw Air-like background rings in windows and/or menus.
    Note: to use an SVG instead of the hard-coded air-like rings, edit
          ~/.config/qtcurve/stylerc (or /etc/qtcurvestylerc) and add:

          bgndImage=file
          bgndImage.file=/path/to/svg/file.svg
          bgndImage.width=120
          bgndImage.height=160

    calling GTK_WIDGET_??? macros.
34. Dont max round toggle buttons that are almost square, or GIMPs GimpViewableButtons
35. gtkMenuStripe option replaced by noMenuStripeApps option. noMenuStripeApps=gtk is
    the equivalent of gtkMenuStripe=false
36. Better Agua gradients for large buttons.

0.69.2
------
1. If a scrollbar slider is maxed-out, then shade it as disabled - matches KDE.

   combo types. (Affects combos in pidgin.)
7. Fix disabled editable combos.
8. It has been reported that under intel Xorg drivers > 2.8, that QtCurve's
   arrows are not appearing. This seems to be due to the fact that QtCurve is
   using cairo to draw non-antialised lines in this case. To work-around this
   issue QtCurve has been changed to use the older Gdk to draw arrows. To
   revert back to cairo, use the following cmake option:

    -DQTC_USE_CAIRO_FOR_ARROWS=true

0.68.1

   pixel lower.
2. Fix plastik style mouse over on scrollbars.

0.67.2
------
1. Fix text placement in pushbuttons.

13. GTK: More KDE like menu sizing.
14. KDE: Fix/hack for OO.o2.x menubars. If the selected menu colour is toodark,
         then lighten. This is required as OO.o always draws the menu text
         dark! It seems to have a check for plastik style though, and then
         it draws selected popup menu items white.

0.21
----

2. KDE: Use ::qt_cast<type *>(widget) as opposed to widget->inherits("type") whenever
        possible.
3. GTK2: Compile fix.

0.17.2
------
1. GTK: Compile fix when compiled with KDE<3.2

0.17.1
------
1. KDE: Use Qt 3.1 for ui file - so that will compile with Qt3.2, etc...
        (Using 3.1 as I only have 3.1 and 3.3 installed...)

0.17
----
1.  GTK: Compile fix - used C++ syntax in C code, oops...
2.  GTK2: Make focus rects more like KDE's
3.  KDE: Allow combo-boxes and scrollbars to be recoloured.
4:  ALL: If compiled with KDE3.2 then there is only 1 style "QtCurve", and
         only 1 set of GTK gtkrc files installed. Variation (V1, V2, V3, or
         custom) can then be selected via KControl.

         (NOTE: When upgrading from KDE3.1, you may wish to uninstall the
         previous QtCurve release - to remove the old V2 and V3 config files)
5:  ALL: Better non-bordered gradient radio/checks.
6:  ALL: Option to use non gradient progress/menu bar indicator.
7:  GTK: Don't shade paned widgets!
8:  ALL: V1 has flat progress bar and menuitems - i.e. no gradient effect.

         for progress bar and menuitems.
10: KDE: Better AA'ing of edges of round buttons.
11: GTK: Fix for background colour of selected text, thanks to David RodrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½uez GarcÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½
12: ALL: Use KDE's contrast setting.
13: KDE: Implement tri-state checkmarks.
14: ALL: Better bottom/right tab gradients.
15: KDE: (Qt>=3.2) the text/icon of a selected bottom tab moves down 1 pixel.
16: KDE: (Qt>=3.2) Only highlight text/check label if mouse is over sensitive area.
17: KDE: Mimic GTK's scrollbar highlighting. i.e. only highlight slider if mouse is
         over slider area, and likewise for the buttons.
18: KDE: When kicker is set to transparent (may need to restart kicker), use "harsh"
         rounded buttons in round mode. (i.e. don't AA the corners)
19: KDE: Modified button size code - KDE3.2's kcalc is smaller now!
20: KDE: Don't flatten combo box arrow area when selected - more GTK like.
21: KDE: Highlight clickable listview headers on mouse over - more GTK like.
22: GTK: HScrollBar fix.
23: KDE: More Gtk like shading of buttons - i.e. always dark when pressed.
24: ALL: Slight change to look of combo-box.
25: KDE: Fix for tabwidgets in konqueror, etc.

0.16
----

2: ALL: V3 - Embolden font of default button.
3: ALL: V3 - Lighter background for disabled check/radios.
4: ALL: V3 - Correct AA colour for radio indicator.
5: KDE: Draw triangular tabs the same as rounded - prevous versions defaulted to
        KStyle.
6: KDE: Add 10pix (2*10) border to non-default buttons.
7: KDE: Implement masks for checks and radios - helps with khtml.

0.15
----
1.  KDE: Smaller, more Gtk-like toolbar separators.
2.  ALL: When drawing rounded, use background colour for corner pixels.
3.  ALL: V2, use a shade of the button colour for the default indicator.
4.  ALL: V3, as for V2 above, but "round" the indicator.
5.  KDE: When compiled for Qt 3.2, only highlight pixmap and text on mouse over
         for radio and checkboxes - as these are the only sensitive parts. (Qt < 3.2
         the whole widget is sensitive - and this can expand past text.)
6.  KDE: Fix bottom tabs - i.e. movement of text/icon. (Qt >= 3.2 !)
7.  GTK: Fix bottom tabs on V1
8.  ALL: More rounded buttons, etc.
9:  ALL: Rounded indicator boxes in rounded mode.
10: ALL: Better radio buttons.
11: KDE: Use rounded buttons for Kicker taskbar as well - looks OK now buttons are more
         rounded.
12: GTK: Fix gradient rendering bug - seemed to affect GTK1 glade buttons. (When a partial
         button had to be re-drawn, the whole button was re-drawn instead - clearing out the
         text!)
13: GTK: Use "check" for check and radio's in menus - more Qt like.
14: ALL: V3 - Gradient radio's and checks.

0.14
----
1. GTK2: Set slider width to 16 pixels to better match KDE.
2. GTK: Draw border around toolbar buttons 1 pixel smaller - saves overlap with frame.
3. GTK: Better tabs - GIMP 1.3's tab icons should now move. (GIMP's tabs are shaded
        tho, hmm...)
4. ALL: V3 style uses "pyramid" (i.e. non "V" like) arrows.
5. KDE: Fix for menubar background if button colour != background colour.
6. KDE: Fix for background of "Location:" on konqueror.
7. GTK: Better lsitview headers - smaller, more KDE like.
8. GTK: Reduce differences in V1, V2, and V3 gtkrc files to the bare minimum - ready
        for only 1 (KControl) configurable style.
9. GTK1: Fix (hack really) for range grooves. For some reason these were not being
         drawn when first displayed. Works ok for ranges - but scrollbar grooves are still
         messed up! The redraw only happens after you leave the widget!

0.13
----
1. ALL: New V3 style - has rounded buttons, and uses gradient effect on buttons, tabs,
        scrollbars, etc. 
2. ALL: Code clean-up.

0.12
----
1. KDE: Don't have flat buttons - i.e in printmgr, and kscd.
2. KDE: Default frame width of 1.
3. KDE: Fix mouse-over for some toolbar buttons - the on/off type. Affects most KDE styles,
        but a real KDE fix should be in KDE3.2
4. GTK2: Fix bug where V2 style options were being ignored.
5. GTK2 and KDE: When highlight a depressed button, use a lighter
                 shade of the depressed colour - and not the standard
                 highlight colour.
6. GTK: Active tab bar text is 1 pixel higher - a la KDE.
7. KDE: Fix for borded bottom tabs.

0.11
----
1. GTK2: Fix possible memory corruption.
2. ALL: Square off splitter - more consistent.
3. GTK2: Fix for 2.2.x combo-boxes.

0.10
----
1. GTK2: Better match of menubar height with KDE.
2. GTK:  Fix up/down/left/right arrows.

0.09
----
1. GTK2: Fix scrollbars for 2.2.x - scrolled 1 pixel too much.
2. GTK1: Fix lower spinbutton height. This was OK, so maybe its a Gtk
         change. But from which version? I'm at 1.2.10

0.08
----
1. GTK: Better menu selection.

0.07
----
1. KDE: Reduce min-size of combo-boxes.
2. GTK: Fixes for sodipodi - works with V1, not too good wrt V2...
3. GTK2: Fix for GTK2.2 font setting.

0.06
----
1. GTK: Make combo-boxes thinner.
2. GTK: Allow ussage of GTK1 font substitution file, either 
        /etc/X11/qt_gtk_fnt2fntrc or ~/.qt/gtk_fnt2fntrc, and format:

        <replace from> <with>

        e.g.

        Arial=Helvetica

        This would cause GTK1 apps to use Helvetica, even if KDE/KControl
        has specified Arial. Idea (& patch) supplied by Adrian Schroeter.

0.05
----
1.  ALL: Don't draw lines on scrollbars if less than 20 pixels.
2.  GTK1: Allow to specify x and y thickness's in gtkrc file - as
          happens in GTK2. Fixes bug with small menu entries.
3.  GTK2: Remove 1 pixel border from menus - more consistent with GTK1,
          and KDE - not for V2.
4.  GTK: More KDE-like menu bar entries.
5.  GTK: Re-do weight ranges - would mean 48 is accecpted as "Normal"
6.  ALL: Now 2 styles:
             QtCurve      No borders around buttons, menus, and tab bars
             QtCurve V2   Has borders - more like original B???/FreeCurve
7.  ALL: Number of lines on toolbar handles is now 2, and 4 for scrollbars
         and sliders.
8.  ALL: Dark scrollbar, slider, and progress background - window colour
9.  GTK1: Fix for slider background.
10. GTK2: Fix error with overlapping check/radio highlight on frame.
11. GTK2: Fix spinbuttons.

0.04
----
1.  KDE: Draw box around checked checkable menu item pixmaps.

         too small for larger.
3.  KDE: Set min button size to 54 and not 70.
4.  ALL: Remove progress bar border.

0.03
----
1.  KDE: Don't highlight disabled menu items - mimics GTK behaviour.
2.  KDE: Progress bar background now matches GTK's.
3.  GTK: Progress bar gradient is now the same as menu bar items - as
         was KDE.
4.  GTK: Progress bar contents now have 1 pixel border like KDE.
5.  GTK: Better spinbutton boxes.
6.  KDE: More GTK like spinbuttons.

0.02
----
1.  Use gtk-config and pkg-config to determine install location for
    GTK 1 and 2 files.

0.01
----
Initial release.
